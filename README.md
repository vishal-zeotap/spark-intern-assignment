Read the following Datasets: 212, 4, 316
Merge records based on identifier and Priority Matrix ( Can be file based or Spark config based )
Intermediate result: One Row per identifier with attributes conforming to the priority matrix
Tasks:
Record Overlap between 4 and 316
Distinct Identifier counts
Datapartner wise count for Age records, Gender records, ZipCode records, 
Final result: 
Join the Intermediate result's Zipcode column with location Data's ZipCode column and add city field for corresponding records.
Apply a UDF for bucketing the ages into groups :
age <= 18 => age = 18
18 < age <= 25 => age = 25
25 < age <= 35 => age = 35
35 < age <= 45 => age = 45
45 < age <= 55 => age = 55
55 < age <= 65 => age = 65
65 < age => age = 75
Show age and gender wise record count
Write the joined output in any columnar format partitioned by age and gender column with single file per partition.
